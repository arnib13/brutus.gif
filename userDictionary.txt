Malik is an Arabic word meaning king Yahoo Internet Life is a magazine about net culture His yacht has a full size game room Don t worry I said guacamole is an acquired taste I m not worried she said I m just hungry She was wearing Salvatore Ferragamo in the jungle I was still adjusting to the new biome myself At first it was difficult to coordinate with the guerillas Her Spanish was good so she became the liaison I read Ptolemy under the southern stars My boots are too formal for the jungle and too casual for the city The work is painful the adrenaline is an analgesic Verizon was and still is a valued corporate partner The banking team is surprisingly well versed in metallurgy I can t RSVP until I have a disguise We arrived at the brasserie dressed as caterers Her svelte figure caught the minister s eye just as Chief predicted Jackie was lucky no one picked up on his accent She served pepperoncini with a tight smile as I photographed documents in the kitchen The minister recoils from the gaudy Merlot pairing is our cover blown We had no idea we were enabling the oogenesis of a new power The gala was ruined by jealous love We retreated to the jungle as fireworks lit the southern sky It was the first of several times Jackie would blame things on Belarus I lay in the hammock at base dreaming of LA We would resume our reconnaissance in the morning for now we tried to forget about the mission This is all I was able to procure she said producing a bottle of Dom P rignon Glyph sulked in his tent as the rest of us gathered for pinochle Chief who had posed as a waiter said Lasso had been seated at the president s table I finished the last of the now warm champagne and said goodnight She stumbled into my tent an hour later surprisingly tipsy for a femme fatale Eventually I yield to uneasy jungle dreams A temple of finance two thousand feet above the mega city They each have a Sausage McMuffin around the corner it s the only affordable meal in the Zone The radio still works in the elevator of course A familiar feeling has he been in this building before He s wearing his formal uniform white shoes red suit blue radio You can dress for success but you can t have it all We awoke to the sound of Jackie strumming a mournful Latin melody on his guitar I knew immediately that something was wrong He seemed absent as we planned the route for the day s expedition We would hike to the beach stopping in town for a cerveza Even in times of war we must occasionally enjoy a drink with friends We are cursed with an impossible mission in hell I said taking the final slice of breakfast quiche Excuse me said Jackie I had planned to eat that Okay I said let s split it Is nothing sacred said Jackie struggling to get the words out Even in her bulky field gear she looked pretty hot I must have had some idea that we were doomed but I was too young to care Who can regulate the economics of passion Back then I only had two things to live for her and the mission We hiked without speaking listening to the sounds of the jungle In such an unfamiliar place you lose track of what is real I resolved to speak with Dr Colorado as soon as I returned to LA We saw three guerrillas approaching with unhappy faces I hoped they wouldn t notice my American accent They did not prepare me for this in school or on the job training In moments of carnage it was clear that battle was fun for Jackie I had a cyanide caramel in my pocket in case I was captured Through the pain I tried to recall happier times spent in Jubilee Tower on 2 for 1 Tuesdays We tried to netride for help but unsurprisingly our router was down When the assault became unbearable Glyph used his aegis to shield our party It was a welcome maneuver albeit late I myself had been prepared to use a powerful combat lien but only as a last resort As we resumed our hike I thought of ten mysteries First who was the architect of our mission Third why would a financier of Jackie s status choose to accompany us for field work Fifth what wasn t Chief telling me about the Tlaxcala office Sixth why had the minister sketched an ouroboros on his napkin last night Seventh why was there a five year gap on Glyph s curriculum vitae Eight what connection did Chief s ex wife have with President City And tenth why did she insist we conceal our relationship from the rest of the squad One day these questions will be answered in a splendid exegesis I was certain that someone in LA knew the answers to all ten mysteries Or perhaps I already knew them myself We reached the beach just in time for an exquisite ocean sunset I shed my clothes and jumped into the ocean It amuses me now to recall how I took my physical body for granted Chief and Jackie were already unpacking the food bag it was their turn to prepare dinner Jackie used a kukri to chop tomatoes slicing with violent intensity Why was he always so grim when preparing Italian food Chief was in charge of the aubergine which he cultivated himself back in LA When the risotto was properly al dente Chief called the team to a makeshift dinner table Fourth what secret research led to our loci in Nicaragua Friendship money love these are difficult words for a regulator Nicole slipped out of her hiking uniform into a slim Karl Lagerfeld ensemble Nicole slipped out of her Karl Lagerfeld ensemble into a simple Yigal Azrou l gown Ninth what would happen to this country and its economy if we won Second why did the Regulators Office acquiesce to working with the banks She is the finest regulator I have ever worked with That was the last time I was with Nicole her image still lingers in my new conciousness system The two of us would have to reconcile later we had to leave immediately to reach the beach by nightfall Bon
